Overall Page Structure & Backgrounds:

Task: Set Background Colors.

The main view background color should remain as it is in the current design (the light greyish/off-white).

The central content area (timer, start/goal, button) should be contained within a Card Element.

Card Background Color: White (#FFFFFF).

Card Corner Radius: Approximately 16-20pt.

1. Header Section (Top Bar)

Goal: Adjust current header elements.

Tasks:

Left Element (Streak Counter - Tick & Number):

Colors: Retain the current colors for the checkmark icon (✓) and its surrounding circle/capsule background.

Capsule UI: Implement a rounded capsule UI element to group the checkmark icon and the number "3".

Icon Size (Tick): Reduce the size of the checkmark (✓) icon. Its visual height/width should be almost the same size as the numeral "3" it accompanies.

Number Text ("3"):

Font: System font (SF Pro Text), Regular, size ~15-17pt.

Color: Retain current color.

Layout: Ensure the tick and number are well-aligned and spaced within their capsule.

Center Element (Logo - "Jeune"):

Text: "Jeune".

Day Indicator Style (TUE - Selected/Current Example):

Outer Ring: Thicker, use existing active color.

Inner Circle: Filled solid with the existing active color.

Day Initial Font: System font (SF Pro Text), Medium/Semibold, size ~12-14pt.
